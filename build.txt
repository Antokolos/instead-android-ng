For build, download INSTEAD src from SVN first:

    cd project/jni/src
    ./download-instead.sh

If you see this error:
/Users/sanghuacai/sdl/SDL-Android/jni/SDL_image/IMG_webp.c:123: undefined reference to `WebPGetFeaturesInternal' 
/Users/sanghuacai/sdl/SDL-Android/jni/SDL_image/IMG_webp.c:123: undefined reference to `WebPDecodeRGBInto' 
/Users/sanghuacai/sdl/SDL-Android/jni/SDL_image/IMG_webp.c:123: undefined reference to `WebPDecodeRGBAInto' 

then

There is some build issue with libwebp support in current SDL2_image lib, not sure what it is (I'm on Ubuntu). 
If you don't need webp support you can disable it in SDL2_image's Android.mk: 
Code:
SUPPORT_WEBP := false

Or you can copy entire libwebp directory (which is in external/libwebp-0.3.0) to jni directory.

If
dynamic_mp3.c:169: error: undefined reference to 'SMPEG_actualSpec'
then
copy external/smpeg2-2.0.0 to jni directory
